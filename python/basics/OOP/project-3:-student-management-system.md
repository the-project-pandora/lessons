# Tic Tac Toe Project

In this project, we will practice with the basics of Object-Oriented Programming. Tic Tac Toe is a game played on a 3 by 3 grid with two players marking their spaces with X’s and O’s. You can read more about the game and rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). We will construct this game for two players to play in the console. There will be two classes: Game and Board. Game will be in charge of the gameplay and the Board will be responsible for constructing and manipulating the board. Fill in the following code structure to construct the game.
