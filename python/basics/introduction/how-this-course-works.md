Hello and welcome to our first course. In this course, you will learn
the ins and outs of web development, which upon completion, should render you a
competent programmer.

What we'll cover
This course will thoroughly examine many areas of Web Development.
We will first guide you though the structure of the internet and having familiarity
with git. Later we will teach you HTML and CSS which will make you create layouts
and add some basic design to websites you will be creating in your projects. We
will then move on to the meat of the course, which is javascript and react, which
will let you touch on the more advanced functions that help run a web page. We will
end with the back-end, which we'll teach you how to use databases, HTTP requests, and
express, which is a javascript web framework which will help you create a full stack
application.
