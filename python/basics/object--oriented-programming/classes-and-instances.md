# Intro to OOP in Python

## Learning Outcomes

- What classes are
- The difference between a class and a class instance
- What `self` means and how it's used
- The `__init__()` method
- Class and instance variables
- Classmethods vs. staticmethods

## Theory

Like we've done before, we're going to watch Corey Schafer's Python OOP 6-part series. In this lesson, you'll be introduced to classes and their basic functionality. Watch the following three videos:

- [Classes and Instances Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM)
- [Class Variables Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ-VvGyQxho)
- [Class Methods and Static Methods Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M). Warning: this lesson introduces decorators. It's an advanced topic, which we will discuss in future lessons, so don't be stressed out if you don't understand how to use it.

## Knowledge Check

- Explain what classes are and how they are used
- What does `self` mean and where is it used?
- What does `__init__()` method do?
- How to create class vs instance variables, and how to access each?
