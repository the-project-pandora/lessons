# Modules and Packages

## Modules

- [Import Modules and Exploring The Standard Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqvZ3vGoGs0)
- [if \_\_name\_\_ == ‘\_\_main\_\_’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sugvnHA7ElY)
  <br><br>

## Packages and Virtual Environments

- [Pipenv and Virtual Environments](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/)
  <br><br>

## Exercise

Now that you know about code modulation, go back to the [Rock, Paper, and Scissors!](https://vennbury.com/lessons/python/basics/basics/project-1:-rock-paper-scissors) project and fix the code:
<br>

1. Separate all of the functions in different files.
2. Then import the functions into `main.py` and use `__name__="__main__"` for the main script. Your code should not have any global variables.
3. Run it and see whether there are any differences in functionality. (There shouldn't be any, but your code is much cleaner and now you follow one of the best coding practices.)
