## Exercises

1. Define a function that prints a string that you pass in it as a parameter, and call it 5 times using a loop.
2. Create a function `calculator` that takes three arguments: 2 numbers and a string. The string's value can be one of the 4 values: `add`, `substract`, `multiply`, or `divide`. Return a result of an operation that corresponds to the string. (Use Python's `switch` statement, about which you can read more [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-switch-statement-switch-case-example/)). Don't forget to put a `default` case that displays a meaningful message.
3. Make a function that prints out some message. Define the second function that takes a function as a parameter. Call the second function and pass first function as a parameter.
4. Solve a Fibonacci Number problem. Here's the [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/) formulation on LeetCode.
