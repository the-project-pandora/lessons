## How to Run Python Programs

There are two ways you will write Python code in this course: via Python shell (initially and for simple tasks) and via VS Code (most of the time). In this section, we'll explain how to use both ways.
<br><br>

### Using Python Shell

- <b>Way #1:</b> Open your CLI and type `py` or `python` (or, sometimes, `python3`). If you followed the [Installations](https://vennbury.com/lessons/python/basics/prerequisites/installations) lesson, you should see ">>>" prompt. Type `print('Hello, world!')` and see the output below. To exit the shell, simply type `exit()`.
- <b>Way #2:</b> Open any .py file in your VS Code (try doing it via CLI; create a file if you don't have any) and press ```Ctlr + Shift + \````. You should see a terminal open on the bottom of your IDE. Follow the steps from Way #1 to open up the Python shell and exit it.
  <br><br>

### Using VS Code

- Open any .py file in your VS Code. Type the "Hello, world!" print statement from previous steps and save the file.
- You have two options on how to run this script now. <b>Choice #1:</b> Open the terminal and type `python [name_of_the_file].py`. You should see the output as "Hello, world!". <b>Choice #2:</b> Press `Shift + Enter` to run the script. The terminal should open on its own and display the output.

### Variables

- [Variables and operators](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter1/). A couple of important notes before you read this book chapter. The author uses Python shell along with an IDE called Mu. You already know how to use the shell as well as how to run scripts in VS Code, so we're going to stick to that. <b>Important:</b> code along with the author and complete all exercises at the end of the chapter.

### A Quick Note on the Next Set of Videos

All of the following videos are from the [Corey Schafer's](https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms) Python Basics [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7). In this lesson, we're going to watch his Python Tutorial for Beginners 2-8, as well as some other videos. You simply need to follow links below and - <b>importantly!</b> - code along with Corey. We cannot stress enough how important it is that you start developing the muscle memory now.
<br><br>

### Strings

- [Strings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9TUPpGqYTo&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU&index=2)
- [F-strings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nghuHvKLhJA&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU&index=35)
- (Optional) [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/). This is the official style guide for Python code. It contains all of the official python conventions. For now, try to stick to it as much as possible because it makes your code more readable. Keep in mind, however, that with time you'll learn to recognize situations when this guide doesn't really apply.
  <br><br>

### Numbers

- [Integers and floats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khKv-8q7YmY&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU&index=3)
  <br><br>
