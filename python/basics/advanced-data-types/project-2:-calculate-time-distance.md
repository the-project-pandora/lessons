# Calculate Time Distance

In this project, we will build a countdown timer, where given a date, we will output the distance in days forward or backward from today in UTC time. Access the replit [here](https://replit.com/@Vennbury/CalculateTimeDistance#main.py) and then fork it and run the tests when finished to ensure you finished the project.
