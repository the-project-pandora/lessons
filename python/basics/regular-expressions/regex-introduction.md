# Regular Expressions

## Learning outcomes

- Learn how to create Regex Objects
- Be able to create groups in the regex
- Understand different ways of matching a wide range of strings
- Learn about different character classes
- Be able to implement complex regex patterns
  

## Theory

- [Pattern Matching with Regex.](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter7/) Make sure to follow the author's code and don't skip the exercises at the end: the chapter is long, so you need to complete those tasks to solidify your theory.
- [Regular Expressions.](https://diveintopython3.net/regular-expressions.html) This chapter heavily overlaps with the previous one, but offers a more hands-on approach. If not for the knowledge, go through it for the practice exercise.
  

## Knowledge Check

- What characters match the beginning and end of a string?
- How can you match a character within a specific range of times?
- How to make regex remember groups?
- What function is used to create a regex object?
- What functions are used to substitute one set of characters for another?
- Name a function used to look for a specific regex pattern in a given string? What are its parameters?
