# Installations

## Python

First, we need to install the language interpreter. The installation process depends on your operating system (OS). We will be following the [RealPython](https://realpython.com)'s installation guide. <b>Important! Keep note of the location where you install Python. We might need it in the next section.</b>

Choose your os from below and follow the given steps:

- For [Windows](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-python-on-windows). Follow the "Full Installer" option and download the latest version.
- For [MacOS](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-python-on-macos). Follow the "Full Installer" option and download the latest version.
- For [Linux](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-python-on-linux).

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

- [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This IDE has a store with numerous extensions for all sorts of things, but for this course, you will need only one - [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). Also, turn on auto save by navigating to File and clicking Auto Save.

After you install Python for VS Code, you will need to select Python interpreter for any script to run:

- In VS Code, open the Command Palette by using the shortcut `Ctlr + Shift + P`, type "python: select interpreter", and click on that option in the drop down menu.
- From there, you have two options: either select an automatically detected interpreter (should be the same version as you installed previously) or to enter interpreter path. If the first option is available, simply choose it and you're all set. If not, then enter the path that we asked you to save in the previous section.
- To check whether Python and VS Code is working, create a new file called `intro.py`. This can be done by either right clicking in the empty space provided by the Explorer/Sidebar tab (toggle it using `Ctrl + b`) and clicking "New File", or by opening up your terminal in VS Code (toggle `Ctrl + ~`) and typing `touch intro.py`. After opening the file, your VS Code should have the interpreter version on the blue (in the original theme) strip on the bottom of the IDE window.

## Installing Git and Github Setup

- If you are not using windows, follow all the steps in [Setting up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git).
- If you are on windows, first [install Git for Windows](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/git-installation-on-windows), and then continue to [step two of Setting up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git#step-2-configure-git-and-github).
