## The Command Line

Your command line is a user interface provided by your operating system where you can type commands. It is a prerequisite for us to understand the command line as it will help us install python, run our python programs, interact with our file system, use git, and much more.

### Shells

The shell is a command-line interpreter, meaning it translates the commands of the user(you) into actions for you operating system.
The following are the shells available on each system:

- Linux uses `bash` as its default, but it has support for `zsh` and more.
- macOs uses `zsh` as its default.
- Windows uses the `PowerShell`, which replaced the previous `Command Prompt`. It also contains support for `bash`.

`Bash` is the most popular shell and it is the default shell in most Linux distributions. `Zsh` is build on top of `bash`, meaning it has additional features which provide more flexibility.
Learn how to navigate your system by following the steps for your specific operating system below.

## Linux and macOs
